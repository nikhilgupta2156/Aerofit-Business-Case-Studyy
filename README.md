<h1>AeroFit Business Case Study: Customer Segmentation Using Python & Probability</h1>

<h2>🚀 Objective</h2>
<p>To analyze customer behavior and buying patterns across three treadmill models (KP281, KP481, KP781) and provide data-driven product recommendations for AeroFit.</p>

<h2>🔍 What I Did</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Engineered new features such as <strong>Income Class</strong>, <strong>Age Group</strong>, and <strong>Price Bracket</strong> to segment customers effectively.</li>
  <li>Applied <strong>visualization techniques</strong> (KDE plots, histograms, box plots, bar charts) to explore trends in income, age, fitness level, and education.</li>
  <li>Used <strong>conditional and marginal probability</strong> with two-way contingency tables to analyze:
    <ul>
      <li>Which income groups prefer which products</li>
      <li>Impact of fitness level on treadmill choice</li>
      <li>Age & income combinations linked to premium product KP781</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Identified customer patterns based on gender and marital status for each product line.</li>
  <li>Performed <strong>correlation analysis</strong> to understand how fitness level, mileage, and price influence customer behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h2>📈 Key Business Insights</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>KP281:</strong> Ideal for young (18–30), mid-income customers with moderate fitness (Level 3).</li>
  <li><strong>KP481:</strong> Popular among moderately active users in the 30s–40s age group.</li>
  <li><strong>KP781:</strong> A premium product for high-income, fitness-enthusiastic customers (Fitness Level 5).</li>
  <li><strong>Gender & Marital Status:</strong> Males and partnered individuals tend to purchase higher-end models more frequently.</li>
</ul>
